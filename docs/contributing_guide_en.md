## Understand the Code of Conduct

SiP is an open project under CANN. Before contributing, please review the [CANN Open Project Code of Conduct](./en/context/code-of-conduct.md). All subsequent activities in the SiP project (including but not limited to posting comments, submitting issues, and posting wikis) must follow this code of conduct.

## Sign a CLA

Before contributing to the project, you need to sign the CANN Open Project Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

Select the appropriate institutional CLA, institutional contributor CLA, individual CLA, or enterprise administrator CLA based on your participation identity. Click [here](https://clasign.osinfra.cn/sign/68cbd4a3dbabc050b436cdd4) to sign.

- Institutional CLA: Contribute as an enterprise representative. Sign the CLA on behalf of the enterprise. This is typically signed by an enterprise manager.
- Institutional Contributor CLA: If you are an employee of an enterprise that has signed the Institutional CLA, apply to sign the Institutional Contributor CLA. Select your enterprise on the application page. After the application, the enterprise administrator will review it. Once approved, you can participate in contributions.
- Individual CLA: Contribute as an individual who is not an enterprise employee. Sign the Individual CLA.
- Enterprise Administrator: Contribute as an enterprise administrator. Sign the Enterprise Administrator CLA. Enterprise administrators have the authority to review applications for Institutional Contributor CLA and manage personnel.

## Participating in Contributions

After signing the CLA agreement, you can start your contribution journey. There are many ways to contribute, and every contribution is welcome and valued.

You can report, discuss, and track all issues you discover or new ideas you want to contribute through [Issues](#submit-issue--handle-issue-tasks), and close the associated issues after the [contribution coding](#contribution-coding) Pull-Request is merged.

3. Code Download and Contribution Process
![Code Contribution Process](./zh/API_Reference/figures/docs_images_contrib_flow.png)
   (1) Before starting code development, first fork the required SiP repository to your personal repository, then download the personal repository to your local machine. Make code modifications on a local branch.
   (2) After code validation meets the contribution requirements, submit a Pull-Request to contribute the code to SiP. You can find the submitted Pull-Request in the [Pull-Request list](https://gitcode.com/cann/sip/pulls).
   (3) In the comment section of the submitted Pull-Request, comment `compile` to trigger compilation.
   (4) Pay attention to viewing the gate test results. If the test does not pass, modify the local code based on the problem prompts. If the test passes, the PR will be assigned to a committer for review. Pay attention to the committer's review comments.
   (5) After your PR is reviewed and approved, the code will be merged into the SiP source code repository.
